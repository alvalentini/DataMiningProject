## Identification of interesting news combinations in Twitter.

We are not interested in topic detection only, but going one step ahead that is groups of topics and dependencies between them. The idea is that we look at the twitter data, detect the topics and identify correlations among the different topics. Furthermore, we would like to create a profile of the users that indicate what are the characteristic interests of each user.
